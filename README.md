# Blender workspace

Blender workspace is a repository that contains default startup files that have been customized to my liking

## Installation

Download the repository or download from latest release and open the file called `default.blend` in Blender. Then go to `File > Defaults > Save Startup File` to save the file as the default startup file.

## Customisation

This blend file contains over 30 workspaces. Having this many workspaces can be overwhelming, so I recommend removing the ones you don't need at the start of your projects or when you install the blend file. To remove a workspace, right-click on the workspace tab and click `Remove`. This wont delete the workspace, it will just remove it from the current file. If you want to add a workspace back, drag and drop the `default.blend` file into the Blender window and click `Append` and navigate to `Workspaces` and select the workspace you want to add.
